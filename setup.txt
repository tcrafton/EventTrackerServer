In new folder:

npm init (creates package.json)

npm install --save express mongoose morgan body-parser
  * morgan is for logging
  * body-parser will parse incoming traffic as json (assuming that's how we set it up)

create and setup index.js (starting point of application, also where you setup your middleware)
  * at this point you can start the server by running 'node index.js'

create .gitignore and add "node_modules" (tells git to ignore the node_modules folder)

install nodemon (watches project directory for any file changes)

in the scripts section of package.json add:
  - "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  - this will allow us to run 'npm run dev' from the command line to now start our
    server using nodemon

create file router.js for the route handlers
  - import this file in index.js and call it with app
  - ex: router(app)

create a models folder for the individual models (schemas) created using mongoose

in index.js add connection to your mongo db

add a controllers folder, see 'controller architecture.jpg' for example of flow with controllers

install bcrypt-nodejs to encrypt passwords

setup up authentication in an authentication controller

install jwt-simple for creating JSON web tokens

create config.js for holding secrets and config info

add config.js to .gitignore

add secret string to config.js for creating JSON web tokens

install passport and passport-jwt  (use passport to see if a user is authenticated to use our application)

create a services folder

create passport.js in services folder

install passport-local
